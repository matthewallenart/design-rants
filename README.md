# design-rants

Design rants are passionate, often blunt expressions of frustration from professionals and users about the current state of digital design, particularly in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). These critiques highlight recurring issues such as over-engineered interfaces, minimalist trends that sacrifice usability, poor accessibility, and the growing disconnect between design aesthetics and real user needs. Whether emerging from industry veterans, burned-out designers, or everyday users, these rants reflect deeper concerns about how design decisions are driven—often prioritizing business metrics, trends, or internal politics over thoughtful, human-centered experiences. Collectively, they form an important pulse check on where the design field is thriving, stagnating, or outright failing.
